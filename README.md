# Jargon NodeJS SDKs

This repo contains Jargon's nodejs SDKs for voice platform content management.

Our first supported platform is Alexa: [@jargon/alexa-skill-sdk](https://github.com/JargonInc/jargon-sdk-nodejs/tree/master/packages/alexa-skill-sdk).

Currently all functionality lives in that one package, but common pieces will be factored out into a core library once
we launch the SDK for additional platforms, hence the lerna setup.

## Support

Please file an issue detailing any problems you run into, questions on use, or suggestions on what we can do to make your
life easier!
